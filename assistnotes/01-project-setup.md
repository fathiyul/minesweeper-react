Let's set up the project for your Minesweeper game using Create React App, which is a popular and straightforward way to start a new React project. Here's how we'll do it:

1. First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer. If you don't, download and install it from the official Node.js website.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.

4. Run the following command to create a new React project:

   ```
   npx create-react-app minesweeper-react
   ```

5. Once the installation is complete, navigate into your new project folder:

   ```
   cd minesweeper-react
   ```

6. At this point, you can start the development server to make sure everything is working:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This should open your new React app in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

7. Now, let's set up a basic file structure for our Minesweeper game. Open the project in your preferred code editor and create the following folder structure inside the `src` folder:

   ```
   src/
   ├── components/
   │   ├── Board.js
   │   └── Cell.js
   ├── utils/
   │   └── gameLogic.js
   ├── styles/
   │   └── Game.css
   ├── App.js
   └── index.js
   ```

   You can create these folders and files manually or use your code editor's file creation features.

8. Replace the content of `App.js` with a basic structure for our game:



```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './styles/Game.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <h1>Minesweeper</h1>
      </header>
      <main>
        {/* We'll add our game components here later */}
      </main>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

```

This sets up a basic structure for your Minesweeper game.

Your project is now set up and ready for development! The next step would be to plan the component structure in more detail.

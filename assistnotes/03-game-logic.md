Certainly, let's move on to implementing the game logic for Minesweeper. We'll focus on creating the core functions that will handle the game's mechanics. We'll implement these in the `gameLogic.js` file we created earlier in the `utils` folder.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the game logic we need to implement:

1. Generate the game board
2. Place mines randomly
3. Calculate adjacent mine counts for each cell
4. Implement cell revealing logic, including cascading reveals for empty cells
5. Check for win/lose conditions

Let's start by implementing these core functions:



```javascript
// gameLogic.js

// Generate a new game board
export function createBoard(width, height, mines) {
  let board = Array(height).fill().map(() => Array(width).fill({
    isMine: false,
    isRevealed: false,
    isFlagged: false,
    adjacentMines: 0
  }));
  
  // Place mines randomly
  let minesPlaced = 0;
  while (minesPlaced < mines) {
    const x = Math.floor(Math.random() * width);
    const y = Math.floor(Math.random() * height);
    if (!board[y][x].isMine) {
      board[y][x].isMine = true;
      minesPlaced++;
    }
  }
  
  // Calculate adjacent mines
  for (let y = 0; y < height; y++) {
    for (let x = 0; x < width; x++) {
      board[y][x].adjacentMines = countAdjacentMines(board, x, y);
    }
  }
  
  return board;
}

// Count adjacent mines for a cell
function countAdjacentMines(board, x, y) {
  const directions = [
    [-1, -1], [-1, 0], [-1, 1],
    [0, -1],           [0, 1],
    [1, -1],  [1, 0],  [1, 1]
  ];
  
  return directions.reduce((count, [dx, dy]) => {
    const newX = x + dx;
    const newY = y + dy;
    if (newX >= 0 && newX < board[0].length && newY >= 0 && newY < board.length) {
      if (board[newY][newX].isMine) count++;
    }
    return count;
  }, 0);
}

// Reveal a cell and handle cascading reveals
export function revealCell(board, x, y) {
  if (board[y][x].isRevealed || board[y][x].isFlagged) return board;
  
  board[y][x].isRevealed = true;
  
  if (board[y][x].adjacentMines === 0) {
    const directions = [
      [-1, -1], [-1, 0], [-1, 1],
      [0, -1],           [0, 1],
      [1, -1],  [1, 0],  [1, 1]
    ];
    
    directions.forEach(([dx, dy]) => {
      const newX = x + dx;
      const newY = y + dy;
      if (newX >= 0 && newX < board[0].length && newY >= 0 && newY < board.length) {
        if (!board[newY][newX].isRevealed) {
          board = revealCell(board, newX, newY);
        }
      }
    });
  }
  
  return board;
}

// Check if the game is won
export function checkWin(board) {
  return board.every(row => row.every(cell => 
    cell.isRevealed || cell.isMine
  ));
}

// Check if the game is lost (a mine was revealed)
export function checkLoss(board) {
  return board.some(row => row.some(cell => 
    cell.isRevealed && cell.isMine
  ));
}

// Toggle flag on a cell
export function toggleFlag(board, x, y) {
  if (!board[y][x].isRevealed) {
    board[y][x].isFlagged = !board[y][x].isFlagged;
  }
  return board;
}

```

This `gameLogic.js` file contains the core functions for our Minesweeper game:

1. `createBoard`: Generates a new game board with randomly placed mines and calculates adjacent mine counts.
2. `countAdjacentMines`: Helper function to count mines adjacent to a given cell.
3. `revealCell`: Reveals a cell and handles cascading reveals for empty cells.
4. `checkWin`: Checks if the game has been won (all non-mine cells revealed).
5. `checkLoss`: Checks if the game has been lost (a mine was revealed).
6. `toggleFlag`: Toggles the flag state of a cell.

These functions provide the basic game mechanics for Minesweeper. They can be imported and used in your React components to manage the game state and handle user interactions.

Next steps would involve:
1. Integrating this logic into your React components.
2. Implementing the UI to visualize the game board and cell states.
3. Handling user interactions (clicks for revealing cells and right-clicks for flagging).

Would you like to move on to building the UI components, or do you have any questions about the game logic implementation?
